# CTB-system-with-UI
First shot at the CTB system. Major challenges I grappled with on this project: 1) representing the turnOrder in the CTB system to the player visually, 2) presenting changes to the turnOrder in a clear way, especially previewing actions the player might take, 3) the coding level work of updating the turn order in real time.
